# 🚦 PROJECT START - READ THIS FIRST

⛔ **YOU CANNOT WRITE CODE UNTIL ALL FILES ARE FILLED IN**

## Mandatory order:
1. [ ] 01-Problem-and-Vision.md (15 min)
2. [ ] 02-Scope-and-Boundaries.md (10 min)
3. [ ] 03-Tech-Stack.md (20 min)
4. [ ] 04-Architecture.md (30 min)
5. [ ] 05-MVP-Breakdown.md (30 min)
6. [ ] Read 06-PROJECT-UNLOCKED.md

## Timer requirement:
Set a timer for each file. When it goes off - STOP even mid-sentence.
Continue tomorrow.

## Why this process?
Your ADHD brain wants to jump straight to code. This system forces planning.
Planning MAKES the project achievable.
