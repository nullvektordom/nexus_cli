# System design

## Folder structure:
```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── [describe]
│   └── [describe]
├── tests/
└── docs/
```

## Data model (main entities):
1. **Entity1:** [describe in 2 sentences]
   - Fields: [list]
2. **Entity2:** [describe]

## Flow (user journey):
1. User opens app
2. [step 2]
3. [step 3]
...

## Critical technical decisions:
- State management: [Redux/Riverpod/etc - if relevant]
- Navigation: [how to move between screens]
- Data persistence: [how data is saved]

---
✅ Done when: Folder structure + data model + user flow documented
