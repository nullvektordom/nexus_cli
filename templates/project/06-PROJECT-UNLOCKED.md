# 🎉 PROJECT UNLOCKED

You've completed the planning phase. Now you can code.

## Rules for coding:
1. **Always** start by creating Dev-Session note
2. **Never** code more than 60 min without break
3. **Always** commit when timer goes (even WIP)
4. **Never** skip build/test

## When project feels overwhelming:
→ Read 05-MVP-Breakdown.md
→ Choose ONE task
→ Do only that

## When you want to add features:
→ Read 02-Scope-and-Boundaries.md
→ Log in "Version 2" section
→ Continue with current sprint

## When you want to change tech:
→ Read 03-Tech-Stack.md
→ Write a Tech-Decision note
→ Sleep on the decision
