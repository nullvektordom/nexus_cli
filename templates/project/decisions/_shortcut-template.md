## What do I want to skip?
[e.g. "write tests for routine logic"]

## Why do I want to skip it?

## If I skip, what happens?
[force yourself to write consequences]

## Time to do it right:
[estimate realistically]

## Decision:

- [ ] Skip BUT log technical debt
- [ ] Pause completely and continue tomorrow
