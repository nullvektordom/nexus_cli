# What am I building? (Scope)

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
Absolute minimum version that solves core problem:
- [x] Feature 1: Add tasks with a simple command
- [x] Feature 2: List all pending tasks
- [x] Feature 3: Mark tasks as done
- [x] Feature 4: Delete tasks
- [x] Feature 5: Persist tasks to local JSON file

## Version 2 (NOT NOW - just document):
- Tags/categories for tasks
- Due dates and reminders
- Priority levels
- Search and filter functionality
[You build this AFTER MVP is live]

## Never (things I will NOT build):
- "Cloud sync or multi-device support"
- "Collaboration features or task sharing"
- "Rich text formatting or attachments"
- "Calendar integration"
- "Mobile app version"

## Tech constraints:
- Budget: 0 SEK (personal time only)
- Deadline: MVP in 2 weeks
- Platform: Linux CLI (Rust-based)
