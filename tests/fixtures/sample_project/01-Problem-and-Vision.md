# What is the problem?

## My problem (personal):
I keep forgetting tasks and my current todo app requires internet connection. I need a simple CLI tool that works offline and integrates with my terminal workflow.

## Who else has this problem?
Developers who live in the terminal and want fast, offline task management without context-switching to GUI apps.

## Solution in ONE SENTENCE:
A fast, offline CLI todo app with simple add/list/done commands.

## Success criteria (3 months):
1. Can manage 100+ tasks without performance issues
2. Used daily by at least 5 terminal-focused developers
3. Tasks persist across reboots with zero data loss

## Anti-vision (what this project is NOT):
- Not: "A collaborative team task manager"
- Not: "AI-powered smart scheduling"
- Not: "Cloud-synced across devices"
